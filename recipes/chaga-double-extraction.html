			<h2>This is the most popular one!</h2>
			<h3>Well, you need:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>A handful of Chaga (1-2â€³) chunks â€“ OR Chaga powder -1.5 â€“ 3oz</li>
				<li>Vodka or rum (at least 40% alcohol) â€“ 0.5L</li>
				<li>Glass jar with a top</li>
				<li>2L bottle</li>
				<li>Wide-bottomed pot</li>
				<li>PATIENCE</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>The steps to make the tincture</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3>Place the Chaga chunks or powder into a glass jar.</h3>
					<p>It is important that the glass jar has a lid that can be sealed, as you donâ€™t want the alcohol to evaporate. Itâ€™s easy to use chunks instead of powder for these processes. The Chaga amount should be around 1:10.</p>
				</li>
				 <li>
	<h3>Fill with alcohol</h3>
	<p>Vodka is used the most cases. It is often misunderstood that the stronger the alcohol the better. Absolute alcohol kills bacteria pretty well but it doesnâ€™t make any sense for Chaga tincture. 40% alcohol works just as well as higher concentration!
</p>
</li>
				 <li>
	<h3>Close the lid and store in a dark place</h3>
	<p>Chaga Chunks and PowderCheck that the lid is tight enough not to let the alcohol evaporate. I suggest to mark the date and month to the jar because believe me, you wonâ€™t remember later, when it was stored ðŸ™‚ You may as well mark a line on the jar at the top level of the liquid, just to be sure your lid is sealed: the liquid in a sealed jar should not go down.
</p>
</li>
 <li>
	<h3>Shake it weekly</h3>
	<p>Shaking helps chunks to move and break apart, giving new spots where the alcohol can soak in better. There are Chaga tincture recipes that tell you to shake it every day. Why? Actually, thereâ€™s no such need to do it that often. Just shake it occasionally.</p>
</li>
				 <li>
	<h3>After 2 months</h3>
	<p>Consumption is quite easy. This Chaga supplement is quite strong.</p>
					 <p>What should be the Chaga tincture dosage and how to consume it? You could just pour the alcohol into a sealed bottle, and use this as is. It is still 40% alcohol. You could take one tablespoon of this, at least once a week.</p>
					 <strong>Pure tincture â€“ 1 tablespoon  once a week</strong>
					 <p>But since you are making a double tincture, not pure tincture, then you have some steps ahead.</p>
					 <p>Do you see those Chaga chunks in the jar full of alcohol? Well, they still have healthy nutrients left in them too. It did not all go into alcohol. We know that by heating Chaga, the chitinous cell walls crack and release all those ingredients. Therefore, it is suggested to make another extraction with hot water from the same chunks that have been soaking in the alcohol. Also, this makes the tincture smoother, because it will dilute the alcohol by 2/3rds.</p>
					 
</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>And Nowâ€¦ The Double Extraction</h2>
			<p>Double Extraction After two months in alcohol, itâ€™s ready for double extraction. Weâ€™ll show you the Chaga tincture recipe for double extraction too.</p>
			<p>For double extraction, pour the alcohol into a glass bottle. Now you want to get most out those chunks that are still in the jar. Remember, by double extract youâ€™ll extract more healthy nutrients out of Chaga cells. Also, the chunks are full of alcohol that you want to collect.</p>
			<ol>
				 <li>
	<h3>Measure the same amount of water as in the tincture</h3>
	<p>After you pour the pure tincture into a glass bottle, take your remaining Chaga chunks and put them into a wide-bottomed pot. Now letâ€™s get every bit of nutrients from them. There are some recipes online that make this process extra complicated. Donâ€™t worry, these methods donâ€™t add value, but just make things more complicated â€“ the results are exactly the same.</p>
					 <p>Measure out the water â€“ If you had 10oz of tincture saved in your bottle for example, then measure out 10oz of water.</p>
</li>
				 <li>
	<h3>Heat it up and let it simmer</h3>
	<p>Put the water on the used Chaga chunks, and heat. When the water starts to boil, turn down the heat and let it simmer for at least 30 minutes. Keep the cover on, because you donâ€™t want the good ingredients to evaporate! Youâ€™ll see that the water turns brown, with bubbles coming from inside the fungus.</p>
</li>
				 <li>
	<h3>Turn off the heat and let it soak</h3>
	<p>After your Chaga chunks have simmered in water for at least 30 minutes, then itâ€™s time to let it soak. Turn off the heat and let it sit for at least 15 minutes. The strong chitin cells have cracked in the heat, so this method is getting the most out of the Chaga.</p>
				<p>Also you want it to cool down for the next step.</p>
</li>
				 <li>
	<h3>Mix with pure tincture</h3>
	<p>Well, now, take the liquid extract from the boiled water pour it to pure tincture which you have on the bottle. Keep the Chaga chunks in the pot!  Typically you should get 70-80% of the water you poured to double extraction. It might be a good idea to filter this through a coffee filter first, so you donâ€™t get any chunks into the liquid. But thatâ€™s up to you.</p>
</li>
				 <li>
	<h3>Repeat steps 6 to 10</h3>
	<p>Do it one more time â€“ Youâ€™re halfway there! Measure the same amount of water as you used the first time. If you donâ€™t know, how much it was, just follow your sense â€“ it doesnâ€™t play a huge role if few oz here or there.</p>
</li>
				 <li>
	<h3>ENJOY Your Chaga tincture!</h3>
	<p>Well, you made it! Now you should have Chaga tincture which has almost 1/3 of pure tincture and 2/3 of soaked tincture, which has strong chitin cells cracked. Now add them all together, including the liquid from this second water extraction to the jar containing the alcohol, and the first water extraction. You should end up with 25-30 oz of tincture, containing concentrated Chaga, and 13% alcohol.</p>
</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now let it cool down, shake it and youâ€™re ready to consume it.</p>
